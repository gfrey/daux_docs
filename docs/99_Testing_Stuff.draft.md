title: Testing Stuff (Draft)

A draft that shouldn't be rendered.

	# some go code
	func foo() error {
		return fmt.Errorf("this failed")
	}

While go is nice and dandy, it's not everyone's darling. Let's use python:

```python
def bar():
	raise Exception("no foo, was missing")
```

How about some scheme?

```scheme
(defun foo (a b c)
	(lambda (x y)
		(+ a x y))(b c))
```

And to quote someone:

> `cat -v` is considered harmful
